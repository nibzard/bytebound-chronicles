🎮 Welcome to The Missing Merchant 🎮
A mysterious disappearance. A quiet village hiding secrets. Your journey begins…

Act 1: Arrival at Millhaven
Setting:
You stand at the edge of Millhaven, a quaint village nestled in the shadows of whispering woods. The evening air is heavy, clouds swollen with a coming storm. The wind carries a faint scent of pine—and something else... something metallic.

Atmosphere: Tense. The villagers move about quickly, avoiding your gaze. Doors shut softly as you pass.

Objectives:
✅ [Pending] Enter the village

✅ [Pending] Talk to a villager about the situation

You see the main path leading into the village, cobbled and glistening with fresh rain. To the right, a flickering lantern marks the entrance to a small tavern, and to the left, an elderly man in a weathered cloak leans on a cane, watching you carefully.

What would you like to do?

Choose your action:

🚶 Enter the village.

🗣️ Approach and speak to the old man.

👀 Observe the surroundings.

❗ Intimidate the old man.

(Reply with the number or describe your action.)

You walk toward the old man, his eyes following you steadily. He doesn't flinch as you approach, simply tightens his grip on the cane and inclines his head.

"You’re not from around here," he says, voice rough like gravel but not unfriendly.
"Storm’s coming, stranger. And not just the kind that soaks your boots..."

His gaze lingers on you for a beat, measuring your intent.

"If you’re here about Garrett, the missing merchant—well, you’re already knee-deep in trouble. Folks don’t just vanish in Millhaven. Not without cause."

🎯 Objective Completed: Talk to a villager about the situation

He introduces himself with a short nod:

"Name's Thomsen. Elder of this place. Ask what you must, but mind your tone—people here spook easy."

What would you like to ask Elder Thomsen?
❓ “What happened to the merchant?”

📜 “What can you tell me about Millhaven?”

🧭 “Where was Garrett last seen?”

💀 “You seem to know more than you’re letting on.”

Or say something else entirely.

Elder Thomsen shifts his weight, leaning a little heavier on his cane. His eyes flick toward the west side of the village, where the shadows of buildings stretch long in the fading light.

“Garrett was last seen leaving the Tarnished Tankard—our tavern—three nights ago. He was supposed to head for the crossroads before dusk. Never made it.”

He frowns, voice low.

“Left behind his cart. Horses too, still tethered near the stables. Not like him. He was careful. Routine. Always checked his ledger twice.”

He narrows his eyes.

“Tavern keeper might know more, if she’s in the mood to talk. But don’t expect open arms—not after what happened to the last outsider who poked around.”

🎯 New Lead Unlocked: Investigate the Tarnished Tankard tavern

You now have the option to:

🍺 Head to the Tarnished Tankard tavern

🗨️ Continue questioning Elder Thomsen

👣 Inspect the merchant’s abandoned cart near the stables

❗ Intimidate Thomsen for more direct answers

What do you do?

You make your way toward the Tarnished Tankard, its crooked sign creaking softly in the wind. The building leans slightly to one side, but its windows glow with warm, flickering lamplight—an inviting contrast to the gloom outside.

Inside, the tavern is quiet. A few villagers glance up, then quickly return to their drinks. Behind the bar stands a woman with auburn hair tied back in a messy braid, polishing a glass with slow precision. Her eyes lock on you—wary, calculating.

“You’re not from Millhaven,” she says plainly.
“If you’re here for drinks, I suggest something strong. If it’s questions... tread lightly.”

🎯 Objective Completed: Enter the village

✅ All required objectives for this act are now complete.

You ease onto a stool at the bar, keeping your tone calm, your posture open.

“I’m not here to stir trouble,” you say. “I just want to find out what happened to Garrett. If something’s wrong in this village, I’d rather help than watch it fester.”

The tavern keeper eyes you for a long moment. Then, slowly, she sets the glass down and exhales through her nose.

“You’re not like the last one,” she mutters. “Outsider who came through months ago—full of noise and threats. Didn’t find anything but trouble.”

She leans in slightly.

“Name’s Rhea. I served Garrett his last drink—three nights ago. He was jumpy. Said someone was watching him. Kept glancing at the window like he expected a shadow to crawl in.”

She pauses, lowers her voice.

“He dropped something under his table. I didn’t see what it was. But I didn’t clean up that night. Something about the air felt wrong…”

🎯 New Objective Unlocked:
📄 Search Garrett’s table for what he dropped

🟢 You've earned +10 village trust.
🧩 Rhea is now cautious but cooperative.

You can now:

🔍 Search Garrett’s old table for the dropped item

🕵️ Explore the merchant’s cart near the stables

What will you do next?

You move toward the corner table Rhea indicated—tucked beneath a fogged window and half-shadowed by a crooked lantern. It’s empty now, but the wood is scratched, the floor beneath it uneven from years of boots and stories.

Kneeling, you sweep your hand along the floorboards. Your fingers catch on something wedged between two planks.

📘 You pull out a leather-bound ledger, stained slightly at the edges but intact. The name “Garrett” is etched into the inside cover.

Rhea blinks when she sees it.

“That’s it,” she whispers. “He always kept it close. I thought he took it with him…”

You open it gently. Pages of transactions, travel notes, and strange symbols fill the book. One entry is underlined heavily:

“Avoid Darkwood after sundown. Route changed. Someone followed me through the pass—not human.”

🎯 Item Acquired: Garrett’s Ledger
🧩 Leads to beat: Darkwood Clues (to be unlocked soon)

What would you like to do next?

🗨️ Ask Rhea what she knows about Darkwood

📚 Examine the ledger more closely (look for hidden notes)

🚶 Leave the tavern to follow up at the stables

🔁 Speak to Elder Thomsen again with the ledger in hand

Your move, detective.

Game said:
You settle into Garrett’s seat, the ledger spread open before you. Candlelight flickers across its worn pages, casting shifting shadows that dance among the careful ink strokes.

As you flip through, you notice:

Most entries are mundane: purchases of grain, spices, cloth—typical merchant work.

But several pages toward the back are filled with symbols—not part of any trade language you know. Circular patterns, jagged lines, and repeated references to “The Watcher in the Wood.”

You pause.

📄 One page has a corner slightly thicker than the others. You carefully peel it back.

✨ A hidden note is tucked inside. Hastily written, clearly meant to be found only by someone who knew it was there.

“They don’t want me speaking. Thomsen suspects. Rhea… might help.
If I disappear, look to the grove behind the chapel. Buried beneath the ash tree.
Do not trust the quiet ones.”

🧠 This changes things.

🎯 New Lead Unlocked:
🪵 Investigate the ash tree behind the chapel

📘 Garrett’s warning adds tension—and reveals he suspected someone in the village was complicit.

What do you do now?

🏚️ Head to the chapel grove and search near the ash tree

🗨️ Show the hidden note to Rhea

🔁 Ask Elder Thomsen what he knows about “The Watcher in the Wood”

🌲 Open the Darkwood Clues lead and head toward the forest

Your choice may uncover truth—or stir something darker.

You slip quietly out of the tavern, the wind now carrying the first hints of distant thunder. The village is still, cloaked in gathering night. You follow a narrow path around the chapel—a small, stone building whose bells haven’t rung in years.

Beyond it lies a grove of gnarled trees, their twisted limbs clawing at the sky. The air here feels... heavier.

There, near the back, stands a lone ash tree, taller than the rest. Its bark is pale, flaking like old parchment. Beneath its roots, the earth looks recently disturbed.

You kneel, fingers sifting through damp soil. Minutes pass.

Then—your hand brushes something solid.

📦 You unearth a small iron lockbox, sealed but untrapped. With some effort, you pry it open.

Inside:

A torn piece of cloth with a strange, three-eyed symbol

A map showing a hidden path into the Darkwood, marked with a red X

A folded letter addressed simply: “To whoever finds this”

You unfold the letter.

“If you’re reading this, I may already be gone.
The Watcher is real. Not folklore. Not a myth.
They took the last merchant too, and no one speaks of it.
The roots of Millhaven are rotten.
Start in the forest—but don’t go alone.
Rhea might help you. Thomsen... won’t.”

🧩 Beat Darkwood Clues is now unlocked.

🎯 New objectives available:

Confront Rhea about the map and symbol

Travel into the Darkwood (dangerous)

Seek secret allies in the village

What will you do next?

🌲 Head for the Darkwood trail

🗨️ Bring the map and letter back to Rhea

⚖️ Confront Thomsen with what you've found

🕵️ Quietly ask around the village for anyone else who lost someone

Your next step could set the tone for the rest of the investigation.

You return to the Tarnished Tankard, the iron box and its contents tucked securely beneath your cloak. Inside, the mood has shifted—fewer patrons now, quieter voices. Rhea looks up as you approach, sensing something in your expression before you speak.

You place the map, the symbol, and the letter on the bar.

Her eyes widen. Slowly, she reaches out, fingertips brushing the three-eyed mark.
“Gods preserve us…” she breathes. “I’ve seen this before. Once. On a charm around a peddler’s neck. He vanished a week before Garrett arrived.”

She reads the letter in silence. Then:

“So it’s true. Garrett knew. And he tried to warn someone.”

She glances around, then leans in, whispering:

“That trail into the Darkwood… it’s cursed. No one’s gone far and come back the same. But I believe you. And if you’re going after this... thing... I won’t let you go alone.”

🎯 New Ally Acquired: Rhea, Tavern Keeper
🗡️ Rhea offers support in future encounters (social or survival-based)

🟢 Village trust +15
🧩 Rhea knows a safer way into Darkwood and herbal remedies that might be useful

Rhea produces a small vial and a patched map of an older, forgotten trail:

“This path won’t be watched. And this?” she hands you the vial, “For poison spores. Trust me—you’ll need it.”

📦 Inventory Updated:

🌿 Vial of Sporebane (1 use)

🗺️ Hidden Trail Map (Darkwood access unlocked)

What now?

🌲 Venture into the Darkwood, using Rhea’s secret trail

🕵️ Stop by Thomsen’s home—he may know more than he admits

📣 Quietly warn another villager (build your allies)

🛒 Prepare more (ask Rhea for gear or help packing supplies)

Ready to enter the woods—or tie up loose ends?

You and Rhea leave Millhaven under the cover of deepening night, slipping past shuttered windows and flickering lanterns. Thunder rumbles overhead, and the village fades behind you—silent, watching.

She leads you east, past the well-worn path most travelers use. Instead, you follow a narrow, overgrown trail, nearly invisible but clearly marked on her older map. The Darkwood looms ahead—ancient, dense, and unnaturally still.

The trees close in as you cross the threshold. Moonlight filters weakly through twisted branches. Every sound feels amplified—your footsteps, Rhea’s breath, the distant creak of wood where there is no wind.

“This forest has its own memory,” Rhea whispers. “We step where others vanished. Stay sharp.”

🎯 Entered Beat: Darkwood Clues
🧭 The trail is rough, but Rhea's map guides you safely through the worst of it.

After an hour, you come to a clearing.

At its center lies a crumbling stone altar, half-buried by roots. On it: a piece of cloth with the three-eyed symbol, smeared in something dark. Nearby, the ground is disturbed—a trail of drag marks vanishes into the deeper woods.

Suddenly, Rhea tenses.

“We’re not alone,” she says.

From the trees, a sound: not footsteps, not animal. A wet rustle, low and guttural.

What do you do?

🗡️ Draw your weapon and prepare to defend

🕵️ Hide and observe—try to see what’s following you

💬 Whisper to Rhea to circle and flank while you distract

🏃 Retreat carefully back toward the village trail

Your choice may determine whether this becomes a discovery… or a confrontation.

You signal to Rhea with a quiet hand motion—stay low, stay still. The two of you slip behind a fallen log thick with moss, pressing into the shadowed underbrush. You slow your breathing, listening.

The rustling continues. It circles the altar, slow and deliberate, as if it knows it’s being watched… or doesn’t care.

Then you see it.

🔦 A shape moves between the trees—tall, twisted, vaguely humanoid but wrong in every way. Its limbs bend too far. Its head tilts unnaturally. Three hollow sockets stare from where its eyes should be, glowing faintly with an eerie green hue.

It sniffs the air, then reaches toward the altar, placing a long, clawed hand on the blood-streaked symbol.

You hear a soft, guttural word escape its mouth. Not human. Not any language you know.

Rhea’s whisper is barely audible. “The Watcher… it's real.”

🎯 Creature Identified: The Watcher in the Wood
🧠 Now confirmed: Garrett’s warnings were not madness.

Suddenly, it stops.

Its head turns—directly toward your hiding place.

You have seconds. Choose quickly:

⚔️ Attack it while it’s distracted

🏃‍♂️ Flee deeper into the forest (risky but fast)

💨 Use the Sporebane vial as a smoke cover

😶 Stay still—gamble that it hasn’t fully seen you

What's your move?

Game said:
As the creature turns its gaze toward your hiding place, you act.

With one smooth motion, you draw your weapon—a short blade kissed with silver—and leap from the brush. Rhea is half a step behind, drawing a small handaxe from her belt.

“NOW!”

You strike fast, aiming for the joint in its too-long arm as it begins to raise a claw. Your blade slices through, not cleanly, but enough to make it reel back, a sound escaping it—like wind through bones.

The creature shudders, then lunges, but Rhea is there. She drives her axe into its flank and shouts:

“It bleeds—GO FOR THE EYES!”

You press the advantage.

🎮 Combat Event: The Watcher

🗡️ You’ve gained the upper hand briefly. Choose your combat move:

🎯 Go for a precision strike—aim at the glowing eye sockets

🛡️ Switch to defensive stance, protect Rhea

⚖️ Use the terrain—try to lure it toward the altar

🧪 Toss the Sporebane vial directly at its face

What’s your next move in the fight?

Game said:
You tighten your grip, eyes locked on the creature’s glowing sockets. Its head jerks wildly, trying to disorient you—but you move with purpose.

As it swings a claw, you duck low, roll beneath its reaching arm, and drive your blade upward—straight into one of the glowing eye sockets.

💥 The reaction is instant. The socket erupts with green light, searing your vision. The creature lets out a shriek that isn’t just sound—it’s pressure, vibration, memory. Trees groan. Bark peels from trunks nearby.

The Watcher stumbles back, clutching its head, thrashing.

Rhea doesn’t hesitate. She follows up with a brutal swing of her axe to its leg, sending it crashing to one knee.

“It’s weakening!” she shouts. “Now or never!”

🎯 Successful precision strike!
🩸 The Watcher is wounded and disoriented.

You can now:

☠️ Go for a killing blow while it’s down

📦 Grab anything from the altar and retreat

🧠 Try to communicate or observe—is it intelligent?

🧪 Use the Sporebane vial now, while it’s open and wounded

What's your call?

Game said:
You waste no time.

Blade in hand, heart pounding, you surge forward as the creature writhes on the ground. Its remaining eyes flare—dim now, flickering. It tries to rise, but Rhea’s axe pins its leg once more.

You leap onto its back, driving your blade deep between its shoulders—straight into the knot of twisted flesh at its spine, where the glowing veins converge.

🗡️ The Watcher lets out a final, guttural cry. Then—silence.

Its limbs go slack. The green light fades from its eyes like dying embers. The unnatural weight that pressed on the forest lifts, slowly… then all at once.

Rhea staggers back, breathing hard.

“That... was no spirit,” she mutters. “It bled. It fought. It knew us.”

From the creature’s remains, something glimmers—a small obsidian shard, engraved with the three-eyed symbol, but now cracked.

📦 Item Acquired:
🔹 Broken Totem of the Watcher – contains residual energy; may be useful to the right person.

🟢 Reputation: You’ve struck down something ancient. Millhaven will feel the echoes of this moment.

🎉 Beat Complete: Darkwood Clues
🧩 Next major path unlocked: Rot Beneath the Roots

You and Rhea stand in the quiet clearing. A breeze stirs the leaves. Somewhere, an owl hoots.

“This isn’t over,” she says softly. “But it’s a start.”

Would you like to:

🏘️ Return to Millhaven and reveal what happened

🕵️ Investigate the altar and symbols more deeply

🔁 Return to Thomsen—with proof in hand

💬 Talk to Rhea about what she meant by ‘It knew us’

What’s your next step, hunter of secrets?
